# Form Manager (Backend Project)

## Description:
This project aims to show how to simulate multiple simultaneous form submissions, handle specified technologies together, store and run backend (NodeJS) on a Docker container, improve DB efficiency by adding Redis layer that will cache PostgreSQL queries, 
incorporate Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL instance that runs on the Docker container, add multiple services to a Docker container using Docker Compose. Technically, this is a full-stack project since it has both front-end and back-end that is connected by GraphQL 
and Apollo Server, but the main goal is having backend that runs in a specific way.

**Warning**: This project runs on 4 separate free-tier services (Redis, PostgreSQL, backend, frontend). Due to the hosting plan limitation, it can take up to 40 seconds for a project to load.

## Application Flow
1. From the front-end a user clicks "Generate Data Form" button
2. GraphQL mutation is executed on the backend that is running on the Docker container
3. A job is generated by "BullMQ" queue (Redis-based distributed queue for NodeJS) which is stored on Redis
4. Redis is stored on the Docker backend container (which is organized by Docker Compose)
5. Then the "backend" service on the Docker container is executed to trigger backend Worker queue (BullMQ)
6. Then, the Worker is executing a custom method that implements random data generator package and uses Prisma ORM to push generated data to PostgreSQL (running on the Docker container as a service)
7. GraphQL returns data to the React front-end

## Used Technologies:

### Front-End:
- React
- Material UI
- TypeScript

### Back-End:
- Redis
- Docker
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- Apollo Server

### API:
- GraphQL

### Database:
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma

### Packages:
- SWC (Rust-based TS/JS compiler)
- BullMQ
- Nano ID
- Morgan
- GraphQL Codegen

### How to Install:
1. Install Dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Create and run docker container: `docker compose up`
3. In a parallel terminal run: `yarn docker:db:migrate`
4. Then run: `docker-compose start app-backend`. This should run GraphQL Apollo server from Docker at "http://localhost:8000/graphql"
5. Navigate to the "client" folder: `cd client`
6. Install Dependincies: `yarn install`
7. Run React front-end app: `yarn start`
8. Open the http://localhost:3000 address in a browser
